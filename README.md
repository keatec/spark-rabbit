# Pure Rabbit Version from Spark-Server

This project is based on the famous 

[https://github.com/Brewskey/spark-protocol]()

To use the SparkServer in an own installation (or multiserver) installation it's hard to interface with the existing API (which is designed for MultiUser, Multi Company, MultiEnd support).

This implementation Provides a Server which interfaces **only using a messagequeue**.

## Implementation

Interface provided

* Events using incoming EventQueues based on the EventNames
* An instance (of Spark-Rabbit) initialize with an incomming Queue to send Actions to a particle connected to this instance

The repository also provides a Client Libary to access the Server using an existing Rabbit instance (```npm run start:client```)

Additional ÃŒnformations

* Usermanagment is reduced to one user (named '```admin```'). The user is created (if needed)
* On startup all devices with a .pub.pem file  in ```./data/deviceKeys``` directory will be claimed or prepared to this user

Note: The System is able to start with a clean Database (empty DB directory) and will create users and devices automatically. (Please note: DeviceKeys and ServerKey are needed on the specific locations)

Note: Starting with an empty database directory is sometimes needed, if the server crashes by accessing the Database (cause of changed database layer) 

## Installation

* GIT Clone
* npm install
* npm run start

Prerquisits

* please install Typescript globlay to compile (if you change code, using ```npm run build```)

On first run the server creates the following directories for storing data about your local cloud:

* ```./data/``` The cloud keys default_key.pem and default_key.pub.pem  
* ```./data/deviceKeys/``` Device keys (.pub.pem) for each device
